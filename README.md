GitHub Repository and Project Overview:

I have created a GitHub repository on Global Country Information Analysis.

Data Extraction Stage:

I selected two datasets from Kaggle that provide detailed information about global countries. The datasets were sourced from the "Global Country Information Dataset 2023". Using Python's pandas library, I loaded the datasets into DataFrames. The "Fact_df" DataFrame contains socio-economic indicators, while the "Dimension_df" DataFrame holds additional details such as country abbreviations, language, and geographical coordinates.

Data Transformation Stage:

I performed data transformation operations to ensure data quality and compatibility for analysis:

Population Transformation: Converted the 'Population' column to numeric format by removing commas for easy analysis.

GDP and CO2 Emissions Transformation: Converted 'GDP' and 'Co2-Emissions' columns to numeric format, removing currency symbols and commas.

Visualizations Stage:

I utilized matplotlib library to create three insightful visualizations:

1. Population Distribution: Visualized the population distribution of different countries using a bar plot. This provides a clear comparison of population sizes, aiding in identifying countries with substantial demographic sizes.

2. GDP vs CO2 Emissions: Created a scatter plot to compare GDP and CO2 emissions. This visualization helps in identifying trends or correlations between economic output and environmental impact.

3. Language Distribution: Generated a pie chart to showcase the distribution of official languages across countries, providing insights into linguistic diversity.

Reflections:

This project provided valuable insights into data extraction, transformation, and visualization using Python. While working on the project, I faced challenges such as handling data inconsistencies, converting columns to appropriate formats, and effectively representing data visually. Through problem-solving and experimenting with code, I learned to tackle these challenges effectively.

What I found particularly challenging was ensuring the accuracy of data conversions and understanding the significance of each indicator in the dataset. In future projects, I would focus on more complex transformations, explore advanced visualization techniques, and potentially integrate machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis.

In conclusion, this project has been an enriching experience that has enhanced my skills in data analysis, transformation, and visualization using Python. I now have a better understanding of the importance of data quality, effective visualization techniques, and the overall data analysis process.
